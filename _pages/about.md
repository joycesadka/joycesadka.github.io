I am a professor and researcher at the Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico in Mexico City, where I hold a joint appointment at the Law School and the Centro de Investigacion Economica (CIE). In January 2021, I was appointed the Head of the Law Department. My main areas of research are empirical legal studies, experimental economics, and technology innovation for access to justice.
